# Learning
A record of my day to day learnings


Since securing a job in industry roughly a year ago, the hardest truth to admit is that I've let day-to-day learnings fall by the wayside. I can't remember much of what I've learnt and this is, admittedly, dissapointing. Focuses shift, priorities change, but it's not too late to come back and slowly get the wheels to turning again.

Inspired by @amitness, who has created an incredible log of his learning journey and focuses on the art of continuous improvement, this will be an ever-updating record of what I'm currently working on or have learnt. For the time being, I will refrain from making a plan, as they often are wishlists rather than something actionable.

My first project, fittingly, is a simple js blogpage, where I will be able to store these musings rather than in a readme on a public document on github

There's a quote along the lines of "people overestimate what they can achieve in a month and underestimate what can be achieved in a year" - this is to remembered
